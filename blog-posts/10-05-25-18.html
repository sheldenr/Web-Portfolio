	        One of my biggest fascinations about the best programmers of our world is how they are able to <span class="italic">manage their time</span>. While being able to set aside time for learning and growth is difficult regardless of circumstances, I feel it has only become harder as we progress digitally. With the internet there is no lapse in information. Always something to talk about, always more things to work on and think about and it can often become overwhelming. 
            <br><br> 
            Today I was sitting in my living room trying to plan out a future project of mine and the idea stood out in my mind because I felt like I didn't have the mental fortitude to actually continue working on it with all the distractions around me. My roommates talking about memes, general political discussions about local events, the movies they plan on watching today and their upcoming plans for Halloween, all combatting together at once. It's <span class="italic">overwhelming</span> to say the very least. I think it takes a lot of mental effort to be able to set yourself aside from all of that around you and I think that may genuinely be a differentiating factors between someone who does and does not succeed in pretty much any mentally demanding task, particularly software development. There is never a shortage of content to look into and separating yourself from whats around you every day has become easier, but clearly one of my biggest struggles as of recent. 
            <br><br>
            I thought this was worth noting so I jotted this down quickly on a break from studying for an upcoming midterm. This is my first post so the structure of these might change a lot from here on out.
