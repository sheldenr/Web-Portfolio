	As of recent, I have spent a lot of time deciding how I wish to best spend my time. I typically tell myself that my main goal in life would becoming the best version of myself, but what exactly does that mean, or entail? There are countless ways that I could improve myself and countless ways that could be classified as being the <span class="highlight">"best version of myself"</span>. <br><br>A couple of weeks ago I was listening to a <a class="highlight" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ephzgxgOjR0"></a>Y Combinator podcast where the idea was brought to me that successful people do not hedge their opportunities. Even those fully capable of completing a task, if hedging their opportunities, will lose to someone else equally as capable putting their full effort into such goal. In my own personal scenario, a goal of mine is to become a Software Engineer, but I still spend a lot of time working part-time whilst trying to grow my knowledge in finance and investing. While these are not directly conflicting, trying to progress in each of these tasks while also working towards my degree puts me in a situation where someone equally as capable, putting all of their time into building projects, learning software development and things to progress themself to that goal will beat my nearly every time. Realizing this, I made the personal decision to quit my job in order to reach my goal. This did however, make me think more about how important planning out goals are, as without specific goals I believe it would be too difficult to make actual progress towards something. If there are tasks that aren't progressing you towards one of your few tangible goals, then it can easily become counterintuitive and a waste of our already limited time. While the discussion can become very cynical very quickly, I think risks are a necessary factor in reaching any personal large goals.
