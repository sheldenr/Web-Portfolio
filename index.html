            Hey, I'm Shelden.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm an aspiring software engineer  based in Atlanta, GA. I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at GSU (state, not southern). This site is meant to be a home to my own ideas, projects and content that I will build upon as I grow.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I tend to think a lot and I enjoy writing it down in some form to come back to, much of which will be here, so feel free to read if you ever get bored.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can view my resume here with a bit more of my personal details, but feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or email whenever.

            I've personally fell in love with the idea of self growth, and one of the biggest ways I feel that you can attest to your own growth as a person it through seeking knowledge. I love learning new things, recently that has been delving in the huge knowledge debt that is algorithm analysis, but also linguistics, geography, photography and instruments, particularly acoustic guitar.
